## topics

- component thinking
- what to test
- how to test it
- `react-testing-library`

---

> `the more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you`

the `react-testing-library` guiding principle

---

## learn to think like a user

```notes
- developers think about engineering aspect
- easy get lost in details but they're implementation details
- painted huge picture without ever asking 'what does the user need?'
```

---

# ðŸ¤”

- what outcome do i want to achieve?
- what do i interact with to achieve that outcome?

```notes
- seems so simple
- how often do we slow down and think about things in this way
```

export default Split

![google login form](public/google-login.png)

### interactions

- select account from dropdown
- type password
- click 'Next'

---

## user interface = public api

---

export default Split

![google login form](public/google-login.png)

### implementation details

- account list loading/storage
- password field validation method
- 'Next' api call

---

## implementation details = private api

they're required for the interactions to occur, but the user doesn't give a shit about them

---

## `and neither should you`

<Appear>(at least when testing your components)</Appear>

export default CodeLayout

<CodeBlock code={require('raw-loader!./code/login.jsx')} />
